# Summary of Changes for Custom Reward Sub-Metrics Logging

## Problem
The user wanted to log individual sub-rewards (components) from their custom reward function, not just the final combined reward that was already being logged.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Reward Metrics Computation (`verl/trainer/ppo/reward.py`)

- **Added `compute_reward_metrics()` function** that processes the `reward_extra_info` dictionary returned by reward managers
- **Computes statistics** (mean, max, min, std) for each sub-reward component
- **Handles multiple data types**: lists, nested lists, numeric values
- **Robust error handling**: skips non-numeric data, handles NaN/inf values, graceful error recovery
- **Returns metrics** with consistent naming: `reward/{component_name}/{statistic}`

### 2. Training Loop Integration (`verl/trainer/ppo/ray_trainer.py`)

- **Added import** for the new `compute_reward_metrics` function
- **Enhanced reward processing section** to call the metrics function when `reward_extra_infos_dict` is available
- **Handles both async and non-async** reward computation paths
- **Integrates metrics** into the main training metrics dictionary for logging

### 3. Validation Loop Enhancement

- **Added sub-reward metrics** to validation with "val-" prefix to distinguish from training metrics
- **Consistent with training behavior** - same statistics computed for validation rewards

## How It Works

### The VERL Reward Function API

**Important Discovery**: VERL's custom reward functions follow a specific API:

```python
def my_reward_fn(data_source, solution_str, ground_truth, extra_info=None, **kwargs):
    """
    Args:
        data_source (str): Dataset identifier (e.g., "openai/gsm8k")
        solution_str (str): Model's generated response 
        ground_truth (str): Expected answer
        extra_info (dict): Additional info (may include num_turns, etc.)
        **kwargs: Additional parameters from reward_kwargs in config
    
    Returns:
        float/int OR dict: Either just the score, or dict with 'score' + sub-rewards
    """
```

### Integration Flow

1. **Custom Reward Function** returns a dictionary:
   ```python
   return {
       "score": final_combined_reward,     # Used for actual training (required)
       "fluency_score": fluency_value,     # Sub-rewards logged as metrics
       "relevance_score": relevance_value,
       "safety_score": safety_value
   }
   ```

2. **Reward Manager** (e.g., `NaiveRewardManager`) processes each sample:
   - Calls custom reward function with string parameters
   - Collects `reward_extra_info` from returned dictionaries
   - Returns both reward tensor and extra info to training loop

3. **Training Loop** automatically logs sub-reward metrics:
   - Training: `reward/fluency_score/mean`, `reward/fluency_score/max`, etc.
   - Validation: `val-reward/fluency_score/mean`, `val-reward/fluency_score/max`, etc.

4. **Backward Compatible** - existing reward functions that return just float/int continue to work

## Files Modified

1. `verl/trainer/ppo/reward.py` - Added metrics computation function
2. `verl/trainer/ppo/ray_trainer.py` - Integrated metrics into training and validation loops

## Files Added (Examples & Documentation)

1. `examples/custom_reward_function_example.py` - Corrected example implementations
2. `examples/custom_reward_config_example.yaml` - Corrected configuration examples
3. `docs/custom_reward_logging.md` - Updated comprehensive documentation
4. `test_reward_metrics.py` - Test script for validation

## Key Insights

- **VERL already supported** sub-reward logging through reward managers
- **The missing piece** was extracting and logging these metrics in the training loop
- **No changes needed** to the reward manager system - it was already designed correctly
- **Custom reward functions** should return dictionaries with sub-rewards, not modify the DataProto processing

## Benefits

- **Detailed Monitoring**: Track individual reward components during training
- **Debugging Aid**: Identify which reward components are working well vs poorly
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Monitor how different weights affect individual components
- **Research Insights**: Better understand reward function behavior over time
- **Zero Overhead**: Only computes metrics when extra info is provided

## Usage

Simply modify your custom reward function to return the dictionary format:

```python
def my_reward(data_source, solution_str, ground_truth, extra_info=None):
    # Compute sub-rewards
    fluency = compute_fluency(solution_str)
    relevance = compute_relevance(solution_str, ground_truth)
    
    final_score = combine_scores(fluency, relevance)
    
    return {
        "score": final_score,     # Main reward for training
        "fluency": fluency,       # Logged automatically
        "relevance": relevance,   # Logged automatically
    }
```

VERL will automatically log all the sub-reward statistics without any additional configuration needed.
