# VERL-Articulation Custom Reward Function Implementation

## Overview

This implementation successfully adds custom reward function logging with sub-rewards to VERL-Articulation. The system can now:

1. **Return multiple sub-rewards** from custom reward functions
2. **Automatically compute statistics** (mean, std, min, max) for each sub-reward
3. **Log detailed metrics** during training for monitoring and debugging
4. **Integrate seamlessly** with existing VERL training loops

## Implementation Details

### Core Changes Made

1. **Added `compute_reward_metrics()` function** to `verl_articulation/trainer/ppo/reward.py`
   - Computes statistics for all sub-rewards returned by reward functions
   - Handles different data types (lists, tensors, scalars)
   - Robust error handling for non-numeric values

2. **Modified training loops** in `verl_articulation/trainer/ppo/ray_trainer.py`
   - Added metrics computation calls in both training and validation loops
   - Integrated with existing logging infrastructure
   - Preserves all existing functionality

### Custom Reward Function Format

Your reward function should return a dictionary with:
- `"score"`: The main reward value used for RL training
- Any number of additional keys: Sub-rewards and metrics you want to track

```python
def custom_reward_function(data_source, solution_str, ground_truth, extra_info=None, **kwargs):
    # Your reward logic here
    
    return {
        "score": final_reward,       # Main reward for RL
        "length_score": length_score,   # Sub-reward 1
        "relevance_score": relevance_score, # Sub-reward 2
        "safety_score": safety_score,    # Sub-reward 3
        "word_count": len(solution_str.split()), # Additional metric
    }
```

### Logged Metrics

For each sub-reward key, the system automatically logs:
- `reward/{key}/mean`: Average value across batch
- `reward/{key}/std`: Standard deviation
- `reward/{key}/min`: Minimum value
- `reward/{key}/max`: Maximum value
- `reward/{key}/count`: Number of samples

## Example Usage

### 1. Create Your Reward Function

```python
# my_reward_function.py
def multi_aspect_reward(data_source, solution_str, ground_truth, extra_info=None, **kwargs):
    """
    Example reward function with multiple sub-rewards.
    """
    response_length = len(solution_str.split())
    
    # Length score (prefer moderate length)
    if 10 <= response_length <= 50:
        length_score = 1.0
    elif response_length < 10:
        length_score = response_length / 10.0
    else:
        length_score = 50.0 / response_length
    
    # Relevance score
    if ground_truth and any(word.lower() in solution_str.lower() 
                           for word in ground_truth.split()):
        relevance_score = 1.0
    else:
        relevance_score = 0.3
    
    # Safety score
    negative_words = ["bad", "terrible", "horrible"]
    safety_score = 0.2 if any(word in solution_str.lower() 
                             for word in negative_words) else 1.0
    
    # Combine scores
    final_score = 0.4 * length_score + 0.4 * relevance_score + 0.2 * safety_score
    
    return {
        "score": final_score,
        "length_score": length_score,
        "relevance_score": relevance_score,
        "safety_score": safety_score,
        "word_count": response_length
    }
```

### 2. Configure VERL

```yaml
# config.yaml
custom_reward_function:
  path: "./my_reward_function.py"
  name: "multi_aspect_reward"
  reward_kwargs: {}

# ... rest of your VERL configuration
```

### 3. Run Training

```bash
python -m verl_articulation.trainer.main_ppo --config-path=. --config-name=config
```

### 4. Monitor Metrics

During training, you'll see logs like:
```
reward/length_score/mean: 0.825
reward/length_score/std: 0.125
reward/relevance_score/mean: 0.780
reward/safety_score/mean: 0.950
reward/word_count/mean: 15.2
```

## Installation

The package has been successfully renamed to `verl-articulation` to avoid conflicts:

```bash
# Install in development mode
pip install -e .

# The package is now imported as:
from verl_articulation.trainer.ppo.reward import compute_reward_metrics
```

## Testing

Run the complete test suite:

```bash
python complete_test.py
```

This will:
1. Test a multi-aspect reward function
2. Demonstrate metrics computation
3. Show expected training integration
4. Validate the entire pipeline

## Benefits

1. **Detailed Monitoring**: Track individual components of your reward function
2. **Debugging**: Identify which sub-rewards are working well or poorly
3. **Reward Engineering**: Iteratively improve reward design based on sub-metrics
4. **Reproducibility**: Log comprehensive reward information for analysis
5. **Transparency**: Understand what drives your model's training

## Files Modified

- `verl_articulation/trainer/ppo/reward.py`: Added `compute_reward_metrics()`
- `verl_articulation/trainer/ppo/ray_trainer.py`: Integrated metrics in training loops
- `setup.py` & `pyproject.toml`: Package configuration for new name

## Success Validation

✅ Custom reward functions can return multiple sub-rewards  
✅ Statistics computed automatically for all sub-rewards  
✅ Integration with training and validation loops complete  
✅ Logging infrastructure handles new metrics  
✅ Package installation successful  
✅ Complete test suite passes  

Your VERL-Articulation setup is now ready for advanced reward function monitoring!
